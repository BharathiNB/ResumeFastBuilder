## Overview

ResumeFast now includes comprehensive Google AdSense integration for monetization. This guide covers setup, configuration, and best practices for maximizing ad revenue while maintaining excellent user experience.

## Current Implementation

### Ad Placements

### Development vs Production

## Setup Instructions

2. Sign up with your Google account
3. Add your website URL (your Replit app URL)
4. Wait for site review and approval

### 2. Configure Ad Units

After approval, create these ad units in your AdSense dashboard:

1. **Home Banner Ad**
   - Type: Display ad
   - Size: Responsive
   - Name: "Home Page Banner"

2. **Home Square Ad**
   - Type: Display ad  
   - Size: 300x250 (Medium Rectangle)
   - Name: "Home Page Square"

   - Name: "Resume Builder Banner"

   - Name: "Resume Builder Sidebar"

5. **Builder Square Ad**
   - Type: Display ad
   - Size: 300x250 (Medium Rectangle)
   - Name: "Resume Builder Square"

### 3. Update Configuration

1. **Update Publisher ID**:
   ```typescript
   // In client/src/lib/adsense.ts
   PUBLISHER_ID: 'ca-pub-YOUR-ACTUAL-PUBLISHER-ID'
   ```

2. **Update Ad Slot IDs**:
   ```typescript
   AD_SLOTS: {
     HOME_BANNER: 'your-home-banner-slot-id',
     HOME_SQUARE: 'your-home-square-slot-id',
     BUILDER_BANNER: 'your-builder-banner-slot-id', 
     BUILDER_SIDEBAR: 'your-builder-sidebar-slot-id',
     BUILDER_SQUARE: 'your-builder-square-slot-id',
   }
   ```

### 4. Optional: Google Analytics

Set up Google Analytics for better ad targeting:

1. Create Google Analytics account
2. Add tracking ID as environment variable: `VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`
3. Analytics is already integrated and will start tracking automatically

## Environment Variables

Set these in your production environment:

```env
# Required for production AdSense
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional for Analytics
VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```
